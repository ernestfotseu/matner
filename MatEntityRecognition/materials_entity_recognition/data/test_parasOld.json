    "Samples of (Zn1-xAlxO)mIn2O3 (m=integer; x = 0, 0.004, 0.008, 0.012, 0.016, and 0.02) were prepared from fine high-purity powders of ZnO, In2O3, and Al2O3 by a solid-state reaction. A mixture of the ZnO, In2O3, and Al2O3 powders and ethyl alcohol was milled for 4h using a planetary mill (Fritsch pulverisette 6) and a ZrO2 ball as a grinding media."
